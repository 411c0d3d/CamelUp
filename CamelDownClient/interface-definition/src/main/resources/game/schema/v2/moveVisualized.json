This happens, for example, after a player has rolled the dice, followed by the dice animation, and finally the movement of the affected camels from field A to field B is completed. After all players have sent a moveVisualized package to the server, or after the maximum visualization time has been exceeded, the next player in the game order is granted their turn.",
